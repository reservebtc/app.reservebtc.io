✅ Smart Contract Test Suite — 206/206 TESTS PASSING

E2E Scenarios
- Register & prepay → FeeVault credited
- Sync(+Δ) → rBTC minted, fee deducted
- Sync(−Δ) → rBTC burned, no fee
- Empty vault → revert, then deposit success
- Multi-user invariant: Σ balances == totalSupply
- Edge bundle: fee cap boundary, access control, gas snapshot, fixed-fee policy
- Oracle resilience: noise deltas (+1/−1/0), big spike delta capped/revert

FeePolicy Comprehensive Security (31 tests)
- Fixed-only mode constant across deltas
- Pct-only mode monotone linear
- Hybrid (fixed+pct) monotone + linear
- Large params / int64 boundaries → no overflow
- Random picks consistency
- Fuzz: no overflow on large ranges
- Deterministic: zero everywhere → 0 fee
- Params immutable
- Constructor validation: zero/max fees
- Edge cases: min/max int64 deltas
- User-agnostic behavior verification
- Gas usage optimization tests

FeeVault Comprehensive Security (31 tests)
- Deposit credited, withdraw returns ETH
- Only oracle can spendFrom
- Insufficient spend reverts
- Reject direct ETH (receive/fallback)
- Reentrancy blocked (spend/withdraw)
- Tiny spends deplete exactly to zero
- Invariant: ETH conservation
- Constructor zero-address validation
- Multiple operations sequence testing
- Multi-user balance isolation
- Event emission verification
- Gas limit resistance testing

OracleAggregator Comprehensive Security (27 tests)
- Access control: only committee
- Events emitted correctly
- Fee cap boundary passes; above cap reverts
- Large balances accepted (<2^63)
- Idempotency: sync same value = no-op
- Monotonicity: up → same → down
- Reentrancy regression safe
- Proof passthrough (bytes)
- Fork canary: minConf enforcement
- Negative delta no-fee policy
- Boundary fuzz: int64.max limits
- Multi-user invariants
- Gas snapshots
- Constructor validation: all zero-address reverts
- RegisterAndPrepay functionality with mock contracts
- Balance out-of-range protection
- Insufficient funds handling with proper events

RBTCSynth
- Metadata correct
- Mint/burn adjust supply, emit events
- Only oracle can mint/burn
- Soulbound: transfers/approvals revert
- Allowance always zero

VaultWrBTC
- Metadata correct
- Wrap mints + emits events
- ERC20 transfers/allowances valid
- Redeem burns + unwrap synth
- Slash only by oracle
- Reentrancy safe

Security Canary
- OracleAggregator constructor zero-address revert
- FeeCollector selfdestruct → sync reverts, no corruption
- FeeVault security: CEI, reentrancy blocked

Bitcoin Provider
- Reads block height
- Wallet balance increases after mining and sending funds confirms
- Empty wallet returns empty UTXO list.
- Invalid address handled gracefully.
- Mempool watcher emits added/removed diffs, including quick add/remove bursts.
- Wallet history maps fields consistently, including double-spend cases.
