- `balance_snapshots` - Point-in-time balance records (8 columns)
- `balance_history` - Historical balance tracking

#### 3. **Emergency & Risk Management**
- `emergency_burns` - Critical burn event tracking (10 columns)
- `balance_disputes` - Dispute resolution system (9 columns)

#### 4. **Oracle System**
- `oracle_operations_log` - Oracle activity logging (11 columns)
- `system_contracts` - Smart contract registry (7 columns)

#### 5. **DeFi Yield System**
- `yield_scales_participants` - YieldScales participant tracking (11 columns)
- `yield_operations_log` - Yield operation history (7 columns)

#### 6. **Proof of Reserves**
- `proof_of_reserves` - Reserve verification data (7 columns)

### üìà **Supporting Infrastructure Tables**

Additional tables supporting ecosystem operations:
- `faucet_requests` - Testnet faucet management
- `submissions` - User submissions tracking
- `referrals` & `referral_rewards` - Referral system
- `payments` & `subscription_payments` - Payment processing
- Various legacy tables from earlier versions

### üîç **Database Views**

Computed views for real-time analytics:
- `emergency_burn_summary` - Aggregated burn statistics
- `oracle_operations_stats` - Oracle performance metrics
- `user_current_state` - Current user status overview

## Key Features

### Data Integrity

## Integration Points

### Real-time APIs
All tables are accessible through secure API endpoints:
- `/api/realtime/balances`
- `/api/realtime/transactions`
- `/api/realtime/emergency-burns`
- `/api/realtime/yield-status`

### Oracle Server
Direct integration with Oracle v2.1 for:
- Balance synchronization
- Emergency burn tracking
- Operation logging

### Smart Contracts
Synchronized with on-chain events from:
- OracleAggregator
- RBTCSynth
- YieldScalesPool
- FeeVault

## Performance Metrics

- **Total Tables**: 22
- **Core Protocol Tables**: 11 (100% deployed)
- **Total Storage**: ~10 MB
